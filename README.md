## Synopsis

Try Fork

This project is developed because of my study purpose. It used to be a simple events/festivals calendar with responsive design by using default gh-pages provided by github. Moreover, flexible events/festivals can be edit in javascripts/todayis.js.

Curiosity on Git and an assignment(page display different background based on various seasons) has enlightened me to build this project.
